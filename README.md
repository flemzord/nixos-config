# flemzord's Nix / NixOS config
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/dustinlyons/nixos-config?style=plastic)

# Overview
Hey, you made it! Welcome. ðŸ¤“

You've stumbled upon my personal journey with Nix. For over a year, I've been hacking away at this configuration. This repository drives my office PC, M1 Macbook, and virtual machines in my home lab. Along with syncthing to manage data, this Nix configuration guarantees I have a working, seamless experience across each machine I use.

While developing, I've done my best to keep it simple - for both future me and readers like you. You'll see that in how I've organized code, as I keep filename conventions the same across modules. To get started, you can bootstrap from bare metal, run on your Mac, or try out a live ISO. See below.

# Features
* Multiple Nix and NixOS configurations across Mac and Linux, including desktop, laptop, server
* [A single nix-command](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/tree/main#bootstrap-new-computer) to start from zero, both x86 and MacOS platforms
* Fully declarative [MacOS dock](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/darwin/home-manager.nix) and MacOS [App Store apps](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/darwin/home-manager.nix)
* [100% flake driven](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/flake.nix), no use of channels or `configuration.nix` during install or after
* Fully managed, auto-updating [homebrew](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/darwin/home-manager.nix) environment _(yes, Nix manages homebrew!)_
* Easily [share](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/tree/main/common) config across Linux and Mac with both Nix and Home Manager
* Bleeding edge Emacs that fixes itself, thanks to a community [overlay](https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay)
* Extensively configured NixOS environment including clean aesthetic + [window animations](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/nixos/default.nix)
* Auto-loading of Nix [overlays](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/tree/main/overlays): drop a file in a dir and it runs _(great for patches!)_
* Large Emacs [literate configuration](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/common/config/emacs/config.org) to explore (if that's your thing)
* Optimized for simplicity and readability in all cases, not small files spread across collections of modules

### Coming Soon
* âœ… ~Persistence defined under [XDG](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) ([#5](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/issues/5))~
* Opt-in persistence using [impermanence](https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence) and `zfs` snapshot reset ([#8](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/issues/8))
* Secrets managed with `sops-nix` ([#6](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/issues/6))

# Bootstrap New Computer

## For MacOS, install Nix package manager and dependencies
```sh
xcode-select --install
```
```sh
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```
```sh
nix run nix-darwin -- switch --flake ~/.config/nix-darwin
```

## For NixOS, one command does the trick
Download and burn [the minimal ISO image](https://nixos.org/download.html), then run:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Nvidia cards, select the second option `nomodeset` when booting the installer.


> [!WARNING]
> Running this command will reformat your entire drive to the ext4 filesystem.

```sh
nix run --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:dustinlyons/nixos-config#install
```

# Live ISO
Not yet available. Coming soon.

```sh
nix run --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:dustinlyons/nixos-config#live
```

# Making changes
You can edit your configuration and save the changes.

## Build and switch to new generation
### On Mac
```sh
nix --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' build .#darwinConfigurations.flemzords-MBP.system --impure && \
./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#flemzords-MBP --impure && \
unlink ./result
```
### On NixOS
```sh
sudo -E /run/current-system/sw/bin/nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#felix
```
## Update dependencies
```sh
nix flake update
```
